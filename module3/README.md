### Video 1: Prompt Engineering Lifecycle
**What I learned:** How to integrate Prompt Hub with RAG applications to dynamically manage prompts without code changes.

**My tweak:** Modified the system prompt to include "Fetching from LangSmith Website:" prefix in responses to verify Prompt Hub integration. [See changes in app.py](app.py)

### Video 2: Connecting to Prompt Hub  
**What I learned:** How to pull, test, and manage different prompt versions from LangSmith's Prompt Hub.

**My tweak:** Created custom prompt templates for different languages and tested with various question types. [See changes in prompt_hub.ipynb](prompt_hub.ipynb)

### Video 3: Experiments in Playground
**What I learned:** How to create datasets and run experiments to evaluate prompt performance.

**My tweak:** Expanded the sample dataset with technical LangSmith questions and added context fields. [See changes in playground_experiments.ipynb](playground_experiments.ipynb)
